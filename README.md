Utilized machine learning algorithms to predict fatality of aircraft accidents based on various features regarding the event
+ Build unique dataset from the NTSB API and utilized Pandas for data structuring.
+ Imputation of missing values was based on domain knowledge
+ Deployed logistic regression, random forest and boosted methods to identify the best model
+ Used Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall and ROC-AUC scores for model performance comparison
